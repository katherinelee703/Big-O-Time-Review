# Cracking the Coding Interview

## Chapter 6: Big O Time

### This repo is where I have saved my work while progressing through Chapter 6 of Cracking the Coding Interview.

These problems are not part of the 189 advertised interview prep problems, but are the examples from the Big O Time and Space Complexity chapter.

I have taken all examples (originally written in Java) from this chapter, re-worked them into JavaScript, solved them, and included comments on their respective Big O times.

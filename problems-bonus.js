BONUS Example 7: O(N) Time - Unbalanced BST

If a binary search tree is not balance, what is the worse case run time to find an element in the tree?

The worst case is that the thing you are looking for is in the very very last of the bottom leaf nodes. 
If the BST is unbalanced to the most extreme degree, it would take O(n) time, 
where n is the total number of nodes in that tree.

/* 

BONUS Example 8: O(N) Time -  Binary Tree vs BST

You are looking for a specific value in a Binary Tree, but the tree is NOT a binary search tree. 
What is the time complexity of this?

NOTE:
Binary Tree: any node will have at most 2 child nodes.
It is not necessarily sorted in number order.

BST: any node on a left-half subtree is less than root node, 
any node on a right-half substree is greater than root node.

Again, in the worst case, you'd maybe end up searching through every single node since they are not guaranteed to be in any particular order. 
This would be O(n) time.
